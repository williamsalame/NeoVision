# NeoVision
Visually impaired individuals have always faced challenges and barriers throughout their daily lives to keep up with their chores, profession, hobbies, and specially necessities. Satisfying their needs or tasks has almost always required help from a relative, a friend, or even strangers for guidance. A stick was their traditional way of navigating their environment which is not very practical. As a result, sight-challenged people should have access to technologies that aid them to be independent from the obligatory existence of a helper by their side or a stick in their hand.  NeoVision will provide the sightless community a modernistic method of guidance and assistance featuring a suitable shape and convenient size.
